# Flight Booking - Frontend

Frontend service for the Flight Booking project.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
- **JavaScript**:  Programming language for frontend logic and interactivity.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerizing applications and managing environments (optional, but recommended for consistency with backend).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) for JavaScript package management.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dangvonguyen/flight-booking
$ cd flight-booking/frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

Use `npm` to install project dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Development

- **Start the development server:**

Use Vite to start the local development server with hot-reloading:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

This will start the frontend development server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
